# Overview

My first steps into the grim dark world of GO and HTMX, where there is only the server.


## Motivation

It's time for me to become more diverse than just being a Javascript Andy. I've been inspired, to try and build a smallsih app without leaning on my usual tools. Ideally this will help me learn GO, TEMPL and HTMX. Maybe this will actually get launched.


## The STACK

For this project we're using

- GO - The star of the show here. The programming language with the highest paid developers. This is based on some random google searches.
- HTMX - This is how we're going to be handling all the fun client stuff. Will this work? Will I like it? Who knows?
- POSTGRES - Old reliable.

## Retrospetive

In the off chance that I actually finish this little project. I'll write up what I learned here....
